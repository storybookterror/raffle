# raffle

A simple program for running a basic guild raffle.

Takes a list of lots, and a list of (person, number of tickets) pairs,
randomly selects winners and prints out the raffle results.  People are
allowed to win multiple times, with one chance for each ticket purchased.

Example results:
```
Lot #0 (100K Gold) won by Ayrenn
Lot #1 (Recipe: Psijic Ambrosia) won by Emeric
Lot #2 (25x Dubious Camoran Throne) won by Ayrenn
Lot #3 (6 Sealed Blacksmithing Writs) won by Emeric
```
